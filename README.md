Some Basic C++ concepts and examples

As writing rules, please follow https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html

For the ones who really loves C++, I suggest two youtube playlist:
- C++ Weekly by Jason Tuner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJtqHLvAIZE&list=PLs3KjaCtOwSZ2tbuV1hx8Xz-rFZTan2J1
- C++ by The Cherno: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb

(All credits to specific authors)

The first one covers an incredible variety of arguments, spacing from basic concepts to very advanced once; while the latter can be easier to understand for novices.

My suggestion is to start with the second one by The Cherno and then pass to the first one. 

I would try to add a link in each concept referring to the specific lesson

## Coffee Machine Example

The folder coffee_machine contains an example of how structure a "real" directory and some basic classes for a to-do project.
This example shows how you could potentially implement some classes.

See [Coffee Machine](coffee_machine/coffee_machine.md#top) for more info.
