    STD CONTAINERS
    'The Containers library is a generic collection of class templates and algorithms that allow programmers to easily
    implement common data structures like queues, lists and stacks.
    [...] The container manages the storage space that is allocated for its elements and provides member functions to access them,
    either directly or through iterators (objects with properties similar to pointers).'
    (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container)

    The most famous (and used) containers are:
    - std::vector:  in this containers 'the elements are stored contiguously, which means that elements can be accessed
                    not only through iterators, but also using offsets to regular pointers to elements.
                    This means that a pointer to an element of a vector may be passed to any function that expects a
                    pointer to an element of an array (since C++03). The storage of the vector is handled automatically,
                    being expanded and contracted as needed.'
    - std::array    'This container is an aggregate type with the same semantics as a struct holding a C-style array T[N]
                    as its only non-static data member. Unlike a C-style array, it doesn't decay to T* automatically. 
    - std::map      'std::map is a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys.
                    Keys are sorted by using the comparison function'
